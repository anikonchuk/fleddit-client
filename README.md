Welcome to Fleddit, a blog website where you can share your ideas and comments! The Fleddit client-side website was built using React and Redux, and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In order to use this app, you will also need the [Fleddit-API](https://github.com/anikonchuk/fleddit-api), which is available at https://github.com/anikonchuk/fleddit-api.

## Installation

Download this repository. From the terminal (in the project directory), run ```npm install``` to install npm dependencies. Run ```npm start``` to start a web server and navigate to localhost:3000 in your web browser. You will also need to have the Rails API running. See instructions in the [Fleddit-API repository](https://github.com/anikonchuk/fleddit-api).
